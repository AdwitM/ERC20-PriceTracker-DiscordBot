## ü™ô **ERC20 Token Price Tracker Discord Bot**

This is a simple implementation of a discord bot which tracks the price of ERC20 tokens. The bot changes its name after a set amount of duration to the price of the token. It uses the [Dex Screener API](https://docs.dexscreener.com/api/reference) to get the price of the tokens.

This bot can be hosted anywhere you want. I have hosted it on [Discloud](https://discloudbot.com/). You can also host it on your local machine.
